Todo:

    canvas2d
        Why is font size not consistent with Firefox?
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/transform

    Debug mode
        yarn build:release should remove the HUD and horiz line

    Part 3
        Use the HUD to find the 3 points of interest (no need for 3D math)
        Draw R G B lunes
        Add new steps for Girard's theorem
        Lines should have extensions that fade away (to show they are great circles)

    Part 4
        Spherical polygons
    
    Part 5
        Draw a soccer ball with cylinders, use morphing to inflate?
        Inflation and Conclusion

    Part 1
        Refactor to use timeline notation and should be pushed up (earlier)

    animation.ts should just be values (no Filament-specific stuff)

    Get rid of d3

    Load tiny skybox

    Move commented-out intro stuff to conclusion, fix links to 3dblue1brown, etc.

    Data-oriented timeline, generalize to google/scrollytelling
        mobile-friendly template for scrollytelling

    Backup images for safari
        Dig up your iPhone

    Maybe handle resizes?
