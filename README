To build and run the web app:

    yarn install
    yarn build
    yarn run http-server docs

Todo:

    Debug mode
        canvas2d should draw a horiz line halfway
        yarn build:release should remove the HUD and horiz line

    Drawing text
        Use the HUD to test a normalized coord system (no need for 3D math)

    Part 1
        Refactor to use timeline notation and should be pushed up (earlier)

    Part 3
        Lines should have extensions that fade away (to show they are great circles)

    animation.ts should just be values (no Filament-specific stuff)

    Get rid of d3
    Load tiny skybox
    Fix links to 3dblue1brown
    Data-oriented timeline, generalize to google/scrollytelling
        mobile-friendly template for scrollytelling
    Backup images for safari
    Maybe handle resizes?

    Informal proof of Euler's Polyhedron Formula, made with Filament and TypeScript.
    Inspired by "Euler's Gem" by @divbyzero and the videos of @3blue1brown.
