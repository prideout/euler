To build and run the web app:

    yarn install
    yarn build
    yarn run http-server docs

If you have a Filament source tree located at ~/github/filament, you can
also do:

    ./extras/update-release.sh

If you want to avoid accidentally publishing change to your local build output,
you can do this to list, start, and stop ignorable files:

    git ls-files -v|grep '^S'
    git update-index --skip-worktree docs/main.js
    git update-index --no-skip-worktree docs/main.js

Todo:

            fade in at [.55, .6]
