To build and run the web app:

    yarn install
    yarn build
    yarn run http-server docs

If you want to avoid accidentally publishing change to your local build output,
you can do this to list, start, and stop ignorable files:

    git ls-files -v|grep '^S'
    git update-index --skip-worktree docs/main.js
    git update-index --no-skip-worktree docs/main.js

Todo:
