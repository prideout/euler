                    I highly recommend <i>Euler's Gem</i> by David Richeson.
                    It's up there with <i>The Knot Book</i> (Colin Adams) on my
                    list of favorite math books. They both occupy the sweet spot
                    beween pop sci and textbook.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Euler's Gem</i> barely mentions the identity that Euler
                    is probably most well known for, and that entranced me
                    when I was in school: <b><i>e<sup> iπ</sup></i> = -1</b>.
                </p>
                <!-- $\small{e^{i\pi } + 1 = 0}$ -->
                <p>
                    Instead, the book pivots around an equation that you might
                    know from graph theory, which is a field that didn't exist
                    until Euler came along:
                </p>
                V - E + F = 2
                <!-- $V - E + F = 2$ -->
                <p>
                    For any convex polyhedron (or planar graph), the number of
                    vertices minus the number of edges plus the number of faces
                    is 2. I remember thinking this was "neat" when I was a
                    student, but I didn't see the beauty in it until reading the
                    book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The right-hand side of the polyhedron formula is
                    known as the <i>Euler Characteristic</i>.
                    In generalized form, this is represented by χ:
                </p>
                V - E + F = χ
                <p>
                    For a graph that wraps a sphere (i.e. a convex polyhedon),
                    χ=2. However if you draw a graph that wraps a torus, you'll
                    find that χ=0. Thus, χ is a topological invariant. Euler
                    himself didn't make these discoveries, but he made the first
                    step that led to them.
                </p>

                    <i>Euler's Gem</i> describes several results that arise from
                    Euler's polyhedron formula, including the fact that there
                    are exactly 5 Platonic solids. It also describes several
                    ways of proving the polyhedron formula. The one I enjoyed
                    reading the most was Legendre's proof, which is purely
                    geometrical and leverages some interesting properties of
                    geodesic triangles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this page I will present a variation of Legendre's proof
                    using scrollytelling, TypeScript, and my favorite library
                    for making 3D graphics, <a
                    href="https://github.com/google/filament">Filament</a>.
                    Simply scroll downwards at your own pace (hopefully not too
                    fast). The proof is divided into 5 steps:

                    By the way, 3blue1brown has a a great video on the
                    polyhedron formula <a href="TODO">here</a>, as well as <a
                    href="TODO">this</a> video about the surface of a sphere,
                    which brings us to the first step...

                        <h2>Part 1: Surface Area of Sphere</h2>
                        <p>
                            The surface area of a sphere can be derived with
                            freshman calculus but was discovered by Archimedes
                            long before the invention of calculus.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top:500px">
                            Archimedes realized that the surface area of a
                            sphere is equal to the area of its smallest
                            enclosing cylinder, which is
                            <mathspan>4πr<sup>2</sup></mathspan>. This is
                            somewhat intuitive if you think about lat-long
                            rectangles.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top:150px"> 
                            At the equator, lat-long rectangles are fat and
                            short. Closer to the poles they are tall and thin.
                            As they move closer to the poles, they become tall
                            at the same rate at which they become thin, so their
                            area remains the same.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top:150px"> 
                            Going forward, we'll keep things simple by focusing
                            on a unit sphere whose area is <mathspan>4π</mathspan>.
