                    I highly recommend <i>Euler's Gem</i> by David Richeson. It's up there with <i>The Knot Book</i>
                    (Colin Adams) on my list of favorite math books. They both occupy the sweet spot between pop sci and
                    textbook.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Euler's Gem</i> barely mentions the identity that Euler is probably most well known for, and that
                    entranced me when I was in school: <b><i>e<sup> iπ</sup></i> = -1</b>.
                </p>
                <!-- $\small{e^{i\pi } + 1 = 0}$ -->
                <p>
                    Instead, the book pivots around an equation that you might know from graph theory, which is a field
                    that didn't exist until Euler came along:
                </p>
                V - E + F = 2
                <!-- $V - E + F = 2$ -->
                <p>
                    For any convex polyhedron (or planar graph), the number of vertices minus the number of edges plus
                    the number of faces is 2. I remember thinking this was "neat" when I was a student, but I didn't see
                    the beauty in it until reading the book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The right-hand side of the polyhedron formula is known as the <i>Euler Characteristic</i>. In
                    generalized form, this is represented by χ:
                </p>
                V - E + F = χ
                <p>
                    For a graph that wraps a sphere (i.e. a convex polyhedron), χ=2. However if you draw a graph that
                    wraps a torus, you'll find that χ=0. Thus, χ is a topological invariant. Euler himself didn't make
                    these discoveries, but he made the first step that led to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Euler's Gem</i> describes several results that arise from Euler's polyhedron formula, including
                    the fact that there are exactly 5 Platonic solids. It also describes several ways of proving the
                    polyhedron formula. The one I enjoyed reading the most was Legendre's proof, which is purely
                    geometrical and leverages some interesting properties of geodesic triangles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this page I will present a variation of Legendre's proof using scrollytelling, TypeScript, and my
                    favorite library for making 3D graphics, <a href="https://github.com/google/filament">Filament</a>.

                    The proof is divided into 5 steps:

                    By the way, 3blue1brown has a a great video on the polyhedron formula <a href="TODO">here</a>, as
                    well as <a href="TODO">this</a> video about the surface of a sphere, which brings us to the first

                        <h2>Part 1: Surface Area of Sphere</h2>
                        <p>
                            The surface area of a sphere can be derived with freshman calculus, but it was discovered by
                            Archimedes long before the invention of calculus.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top:200px">
                            Archimedes realized that the surface area of a sphere is equal to the area of its smallest
                            enclosing cylinder, which is
                            <mathspan>4πr<sup>2</sup></mathspan>. This is somewhat intuitive if you think about lat-long
                            rectangles.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top:200px"> 
                            At the equator, lat-long rectangles are fat and short. Closer to the poles they are tall and
                            thin. As they move closer to the poles, they become tall at the same rate at which they
                            become thin, so their area remains constant.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top:200px"> 
                            Going forward, we'll keep things simple by focusing on a unit sphere whose surface area is
                            <mathspan>4π</mathspan>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <i>Great circles</i> are lines on the surface of a sphere that divide the sphere in half. If
                            you place your car anywhere on a sphere's surface, then continuously drive without turning
                            the steering wheel, you'll always inscribe a great circle. Any portion of a great circle is
                            called a <i>geodesic path</i>.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top:400px">
                            The region on a sphere between two great circles is called a "lune". Let's figure out the
                            surface area of a lune bounded by θ radians.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top:400px">
                            If θ is 2π radians, the lune encompasses the entire sphere. Since the area of the sphere is
                            <mathspan>4π</mathspan>, the area of the lune <mathspan>2θ</mathspan>.

                            The surface area of a lune plus its antipode is <mathspan>4θ</mathspan>. Let's call this a
                            <i>double lune</i>.
