                    I highly recommend <i>Euler's Gem</i> by David Richeson. It's up there with <i>The Knot Book</i>
                    (Colin Adams) on my list of favorite math books. They both occupy the sweet spot between pop sci and
                    textbook.

                <p>
                    <i>Euler's Gem</i> barely mentions the identity that Euler is probably most well known for, and that
                    entranced me when I was in school: <mathspan><i>e<sup> iπ</sup></i> = -1</mathspan>.
                    In a sense this equation not only represents
                    the inception of graph theory, but also topology. The right-hand side is known as the <i>Euler
                    Characteristic</i>. In generalized form, this is represented by <mathspan>χ</mathspan>:
                </p>
                <mathspan>V - E + F = χ</mathspan>
                <p>
                    For a graph that wraps a sphere (i.e. an inflated convex polyhedron), <mathspan>χ=2</mathspan>.
                    However if you draw a graph that wraps a torus, you'll find that <mathspan>χ=0</mathspan>. Thus,
                    <mathspan>χ</mathspan> is a topological invariant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    David Richeson's excellent book <i>Euler's Gem</i> describes several results that arise from Euler's
                    polyhedron formula, including the fact that there are exactly 5 Platonic solids. It also describes
                    several ways of proving the polyhedron formula. The one I enjoyed reading the most was Legendre's
                    proof, which is purely geometrical and leverages some interesting properties of geodesic triangles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the way, 3blue1brown has a a great video on the polyhedron formula <a href="TODO">here</a>, as
                    well as <a href="TODO">this</a> video about the surface of a sphere, which brings us to the first
                    step...
                </p>
                -->
                <p>
                    This page uses continuous scrollytelling to present a variation of Legendre's proof for the
                    following formula.
                </p>
                <mathspan>V - E + F = 2</mathspan>
                <!-- $V - E + F = 2$ -->
                <p>
                    For any convex polyhedron (or planar graph), the number of vertices minus the number of edges plus
                    the number of faces is 2. Leonhard Euler discovered this in 1752 although Descartes discovered a
                    variation over 100 years earlier.

                <p>
                    This equation makes it easy to prove that there only 5 Platonic solids, but perhaps its real beauty
                    lies in how it connects disparate fields of mathematics. These connections are suggested by
                    Legendre's proof, which is purely geometrical and leverages some interesting properties of geodesic
                    triangles.

                    Scroll down at your own pace, but try not to go too fast, otherwise you'll skip over the animation.
                    The proof is divided into 5 steps:

                        <h2>Part 1: Surface Area of Sphere</h2>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                The surface area of a sphere can be derived with freshman calculus, but it was
                                discovered by Archimedes long before the invention of calculus.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Archimedes realized that the surface area of a sphere is equal to the area of its
                                smallest enclosing cylinder, which is <mathspan>4πr<sup>2</sup></mathspan>. This is
                                somewhat intuitive if you think about lat-long rectangles.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                At the equator, lat-long rectangles are fat and short. Closer to the poles they are tall
                                and thin. As they move closer to the poles, they become tall at the same rate at which
                                they become thin, so their area remains constant.
                            </p>

                                Going forward, we'll keep things simple by focusing on a unit sphere whose surface area
                                is <mathspan>4π</mathspan>.

                                <i>Great circles</i> are lines on the surface of a sphere that divide the sphere in
                                half. If you place your car anywhere on a sphere's surface, then continuously drive
                                without turning the steering wheel, you'll always inscribe a great circle. Any portion
                                of a great circle is called a <i>geodesic path</i>.

                                The region on a sphere between two great circles is called a "lune". Let's figure out
                                the surface area of a lune bounded by <mathspan>θ</mathspan> radians.

                                If <mathspan>θ</mathspan> is <mathspan>π</mathspan> radians, the lune encompasses one
                                hemisphere. Since the area of a hemisphere is <mathspan>2π</mathspan>, the area of the
                                lune is <mathspan>2θ</mathspan>.

                                Spherical triangles are inscribed by geodesic lines (i.e. portions of great circles).
                                Unlike a planar triangle, the area of a spherical triangle can be determined solely
                                from its angles. With planar triangles, the sum of the three angles is always 
                                <mathspan>π</mathspan> radians. Not so with spherical triangles!

                                For example, consider the triangle that encompasses one-eighth of the sphere surface,
                                which has three 90° angles, or <mathspan>π/2</mathspan> radians each. Clearly these do
                                not add up to <mathspan>π</mathspan>.
