                    I highly recommend <i>Euler's Gem</i> by David Richeson. It's up there with <i>The Knot Book</i>
                    (Colin Adams) on my list of favorite math books. They both occupy the sweet spot between pop sci and
                    textbook.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Euler's Gem</i> barely mentions the identity that Euler is probably most well known for, and that
                    entranced me when I was in school: <mathspan><i>e<sup> iπ</sup></i> = -1</mathspan>.
                </p>
                <!-- $\small{e^{i\pi } + 1 = 0}$ -->
                <p>
                    Instead, the book pivots around an equation that you might know from graph theory, which is a field
                    that didn't exist until Euler came along:
                </p>
                <mathspan>V - E + F = 2</mathspan>
                <!-- $V - E + F = 2$ -->
                <p>
                    For any convex polyhedron (or planar graph), the number of vertices minus the number of edges plus
                    the number of faces is 2. I remember thinking this was "neat" when I was a student, but I didn't see
                    the beauty in it until reading the book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The right-hand side of the polyhedron formula is known as the <i>Euler Characteristic</i>. In
                    generalized form, this is represented by <mathspan>χ</mathspan>:
                </p>
                <mathspan>V - E + F = χ</mathspan>
                <p>
                    For a graph that wraps a sphere (i.e. a convex polyhedron), <mathspan>χ=2</mathspan>. However if you
                    draw a graph that wraps a torus, you'll find that <mathspan>χ=0</mathspan>. Thus,
                    <mathspan>χ</mathspan> is a topological invariant. Euler himself didn't make these discoveries, but
                    he made the first step that led to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Euler's Gem</i> describes several results that arise from Euler's polyhedron formula, including
                    the fact that there are exactly 5 Platonic solids. It also describes several ways of proving the
                    polyhedron formula. The one I enjoyed reading the most was Legendre's proof, which is purely
                    geometrical and leverages some interesting properties of geodesic triangles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this page I will present a variation of Legendre's proof using scrollytelling, TypeScript, and my
                    favorite library for making 3D graphics, <a href="https://github.com/google/filament">Filament</a>.

                    The proof is divided into 5 steps:

                        <h2>Part 1: Surface Area of Sphere</h2>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                The surface area of a sphere can be derived with freshman calculus, but it was
                                discovered by Archimedes long before the invention of calculus.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Archimedes realized that the surface area of a sphere is equal to the area of its
                                smallest enclosing cylinder, which is <mathspan>4πr<sup>2</sup></mathspan>. This is
                                somewhat intuitive if you think about lat-long rectangles.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                At the equator, lat-long rectangles are fat and short. Closer to the poles they are tall
                                and thin. As they move closer to the poles, they become tall at the same rate at which
                                they become thin, so their area remains constant.
                            </p>

                                Going forward, we'll keep things simple by focusing on a unit sphere whose surface area
                                is <mathspan>4π</mathspan>.

                                <i>Great circles</i> are lines on the surface of a sphere that divide the sphere in
                                half. If you place your car anywhere on a sphere's surface, then continuously drive
                                without turning the steering wheel, you'll always inscribe a great circle. Any portion
                                of a great circle is called a <i>geodesic path</i>.

                                The region on a sphere between two great circles is called a "lune". Let's figure out
                                the surface area of a lune bounded by <mathspan>θ</mathspan> radians.

                                If <mathspan>θ</mathspan> is <mathspan>π</mathspan> radians, the lune encompasses one
                                hemisphere. Since the area of a hemisphere is <mathspan>2π</mathspan>, the area of the
                                lune is <mathspan>2θ</mathspan>.

                                a <i>double lune</i>.

                                Spherical triangles are inscribed by geodesic lines (i.e. portions of great circles).
                                Unlike a planar triangle, the area of a spherical triangle can be determined solely
                                from its angles. With planar triangles, the sum of the three angles is always 
                                <mathspan>π</mathspan> radians. Not so with spherical triangles!

                                For example, consider the triangle that encompasses one-eighth of the sphere surface,
                                which has three 90° angles, or <mathspan>π/2</mathspan> radians each. Clearly these do
                                not add up to <mathspan>π</mathspan>.
